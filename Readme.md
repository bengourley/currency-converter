# ðŸ’° currency converter

This a starter point for an exercise in how to use choo to write a front end application.

The sample application is a simple one: converting between currencies, but it provides
us with enough examples of tasks (such as fetching data from a server, handling user input,
rendering computed values) that it should a worthwhile and rewarding endeavour to
complete.

This repo provides the "boilerplate" stuff so that you can just get started on
writing the application logic. The interface (html and css) is written for you.

**_Your task is to make this into a functional piece of software!_**

## Getting started

```
git clone <this repo>
cd currency-converter
npm i
npm start
```

The `npm start` command starts the server. It restarts the server and rebuilds the
frontend bundle when the source changes, so after editing source files in your editor
just hit reload in the browser to see changes.
